# SHPRD95's OBS Death Counter Script

This repository contains a Lua script for OBS Studio to manage a death/kill(any) counter with a text source. The script allows you to increment and decrement the counter using hotkeys and automatically updates the selected source with the current counter value. 

## Features

- Increment and decrement the counter with hotkeys.
- The text source displays "Deaths: X", where X is the current counter value. You can add any prefix, for example "Kills".
- The counter value is persistant and doesen't require any external file to store the information.
- Source, prefix text, and counter updates automatically upon selection change.

**Note:** This version of the script automatically updates changes when you select a new source or modify the counter or prefix.

## Prerequisites

- **OBS Studio**: Ensure OBS Studio is installed on your system.
- **OBS Lua Scripting**: OBS must support Lua scripting, typically included by default.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the Script

1. Download the `death_counter.lua` script from this repository.

### 2. Place the Script somewhere in your PC to be albe to add it to OBS

1. **Open OBS Studio**.
2. Go to **Tools** > **Scripts**.
3. Click **Open Scripts Folder**.
4. Find the path `death_counter.lua` to the file where you've placed it.

### 3. Set Up the Text Source

1. In OBS, add a new **Text (GDI+)** source to your scene.
2. Adjust the font, color and size as needed.
3. The source will automatically update with the counter value when selected.

### 4. Configure the Script in OBS

1. **Open OBS Studio**.
2. Go to **Tools** > **Scripts**.
3. Click **+** to add a new script.
4. Select `death_counter.lua` from the Scripts folder.
5. Set up the source selection, prefix, and file path in the script properties.

### 5. Configure Hotkeys

1. In OBS, go to **File** > **Settings** > **Hotkeys**.
2. Scroll down to find the hotkeys for "Increment SHPRD95's Counter" and "Decrement SHPRD95's Counter".
3. Assign desired key combinations for these actions.

### 6. Script Configuration

1. The script automatically detects text sources and lets you pick from available **Text (GDI+)** sources.
2. You can specify a custom prefix (e.g., "Deaths: ").
3. Changes are applied automatically when you pick a new source, modify the counter, or change the prefix.

### 7. Test the Script

1. **Increment/Decrement**: Use the assigned hotkeys to test the increment and decrement functionality.
2. **Check Display**: Verify that the text source updates correctly to show "your_prefix: X" where X is the counter value.
3. **Persistence**: Close and restart OBS to ensure the counter value persists correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Text Source Not Updating**: Ensure the text source name in the script matches the name in OBS. Check for any typos.
- **Script Errors**: Review the OBS log for any script errors and ensure the Lua script is correctly formatted.
